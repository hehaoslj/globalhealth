__The Center for Global Health and Infectious Diseases(CGHID)__  is a joint effort by __[Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn)__ and the __[Bill Melinda Gates Foundation]()__, where basic and translational research into the most pressing problems of infectious diseases affecting global health is performed.  The Center has a mandate for the dissemination of its discoveries for the benefit of society through publication and the principal of global access to innovative technologies.

__Research__ in global infectious diseases was not a major global priority 15 years ago: governmental funding agencies in rich countries regarded research into diseases that did not infect their own national subjects as a low priority and lack of profit potential meant that both governmental and multinational pharmaceutical agencies did not wish to invest in diseases of the disadvantaged. Developing nations did not have the resources to make any major investment themselves. That changed with the transformative impact of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which realigned the priorities in both the public and private sectors, that indeed, ‘every life did have equal value’.  Although the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s work in implementation of health technologies in developing countries has been impressive, the biggest impact on the fundamental research agenda has largely been in the developed world, where most of the expertise in research in global infectious diseases still resides.  With the rapid development of some developing world economies, most notably China’s, there is now the potential for the next transformative step: for world-class excellence in infectious diseases research to be performed and directed from within a country such as China still afflicted by their devastating impact.

The CGHID is a response to these shifting global forces. The Chinese government has recognized the importance of controlling infectious diseases and has substantially increased investment in the field recently. Tsinghua University, as one of the top-ranked universities in China has taken on the challenge of marshalling its expertise and influence on the pressing problem of global infectious diseases.

__At the CGHID__ we acknowledge that China is still developing and growing the necessary talent and expertise required for it to fully take on the leadership responsibilities that it deserves to shoulder.  Therefore the Center will act as a hub to attract experts recruited from around the globe, who share our vision and mission to eradicate infectious diseases.  The Center offers world-class research facilities, infrastructure and support, combined with access to relevant clinical samples and resources to enable its members to perform cutting-edge research.  The Center and its members will serve to raise the capacity, not just of local human resources in the field, but also that of the Chinese government in its setting of priorities and the deployment of funds.  Support and join us in our mission!
