####Research focus

Dr. Cheng leads a research unit studying the pathogenesis and immune responses of flaviviral infections in both hosts and vectors.  Dengue, Japanese encephalitis and Zika viruses are areas of particular interest. Studies are directed at understanding the molecular basis of viral infection, virulence and transmission by animal and mosquito models. His studies focus on the pathogenesis of mosquito-borne viruses in hosts and mosquito vectors, antiviral immunity in hosts and mosquito vectors, molecular basis of mosquito-borne virus transmission, regulation of gut commensal microbiome in insects, and development of novel vaccine strategies against mosquito-borne viruses.
