####Research focus:

The lab research is focused on pathogenesis of HIV-1 and other major viral infections in China. The aim of Dr. Zhang’s research group is to develop drugs and vaccines against HIV-1 and other major viral pathogens in China. His primary research interest is HIV pathogenesis, focusing on virologic and immunologic changes during disease and treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).  His most recent research has focused on the design and development of an effective mucosal vaccine against the most dominant HIV-1 strains in China.  Recently, Dr. Zhang has expanded his research area into highly pathogenic pathogens, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, MERS, Ebola and other emerging pathogens.

####Personal Profile:

Dr. Linqi Zhang received his doctoral degree in molecular genetics from University of Edinburgh, UK (1992).  He joined the laboratory of Dr. David Ho as a postdoctoral fellow in 1993 at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center of Rockefeller University, New York, where he later became a staff member holding assistant and associate professorships until 2007.  He joined Tsinghua University in 2007, and also an adjunct professor at the Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Dr. Zhang is the recipient of National Outstanding Young Scientist Award, privileged Changjiang Professorship, and the Principal Investigator of National Basic Research Project on HIV pathogenesis supported by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.  He is also the recipient of China’s 11th and 12th 5-year Mega-project on the development of mucosal vaccines against HIV, H5N1 and H1N1 infection from the Ministries of Health, Science and Technology.  Dr. Zhang has published over 100 articles in the scientific literature (SCI) and ranked No. 1 among the most cited Chinese Researchers in the field of immunology and microbiology surveyed by Elsevier in 2015.  Dr. Zhang is frequently invited to present his research findings nationally and internationally.  Dr. Zhang has been the member of national expert and advisory board to the Chinese government and several international organizations on HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases.  He and his team is eager to expand their collaborations and welcome passionate, dedicated groups or individuals who believe that through combined efforts, we can make a broader and more profound impact on the control of major infectious diseases here in China and throughout the world.

####Research interesting:

Dr. Zhang’s primary research interest is HIV pathogenesis, focusing on virologic and immunologic changes during the course of disease and treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).  His laboratory is particularly interested in better understanding the interplay between HIV and antibody responses in so-called "elite controllers," HIV-infected patients who have remained healthy despite an extended period of infection.  Dr. Zhang’s group has systematically characterized full-length envelope clones of HIV-1 directly from acutely and chronically infected patients and identified several unique phenotypic features associated with disease progression.  Using various antibody cloning and yeast surface antigen display techniques, Dr. Zhang’s team has been characterizing polyclonal antibody responses in infected patients throughout the course of infection, and seeks to identify the major antigenic domains and epitopes recognized by patients' serum and by broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnmAb).  Molecular characterization of these domains will improve our understanding of protective immunity in vivo and guide the development of more effective vaccines and therapeutics against HIV-1.  Dr. Zhang has recently expanded his research into other human viral infections such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, MERS, Ebola and other emerging pathogens.  Based on a unique human antibody library and high-throughput selection system, his group has been successful in isolating and characterizing several potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against these pathogenic human viruses.  These antibodies could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against these human viral infections.
