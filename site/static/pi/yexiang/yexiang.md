__Structural studies of viruses__

_Centre for Infectious Diseases Research, Tsinghua University School of Medicine_

Viruses are the cause of many diseases including lethal diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis, and yellow fever. In order to infect a cell, a virus must first recognize and enter the cell and then take over the cell’s machinery to assemble multiple copies of itself. Failure in any step of these processes will result in a non-infectious virus. Research on viral infection and assembly is central to the study of viruses. Understanding how viruses assemble and entry into host cells are not only fundamental in virology but also can help develop drugs and vaccines to treat and prevent viral infections. The research of my lab is focused on obtaining atomic or near atomic structural information on viruses in order to investigate their assembly intermediates, maturation into infectious virions, interactions with host cell receptors, and mechanisms involved in breaching host cell defense. We are using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), X ray crystallography and molecular biology to study viral structures and structure complexes. Subsequently, we might wish to apply these studies on anti-viral drug and vaccine developments.

Dr. Ye Xiang received his B.S. degree in Chemistry from Peking University in 1998 and his PhD degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003. He carried out his postdoctoral research at Purdue University before he joined Tsinghua University in 2013. Dr. Xiang’s research is directed towards a molecular understanding of viruses. His laboratory mainly applies macromolecular X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy amongst other modern biophysical or biochemical techniques to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral life cycle and host anti-viral defence.
