####Personal profile:

Dr. Zhang received his PhD degree in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics in the University of Texas-Medical School in Houston in 1997. After a postdoctoral work in St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, he held a faculty position in the Center for Immunology and Microbial Disease at Albany Medical College from November of 2000 to June of 2009. Dr. Zhang joined Tsinghua University School of Medicine as a full professor and assistant dean in July of 2010. He has published many research articles in prestigious international journals, and was listed as the most cited Chinese researchers in the areas of microbiology and immunology in 2014 and 2015.

####Research interest:

The Zhang laboratory studies the molecular mechanisms behind bacterial pathogenesis and drug resistance. The major focus is on the pathogens that cause respiratory infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Francisella tularensis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The main research questions include:
* How bacterial pathogens survive and grow in different host niches;
* How host diseases are generated;
* How the understanding of basic bacterial biology can be used to improve the control of bacterial diseases.
