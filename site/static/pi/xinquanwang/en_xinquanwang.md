__MERS coronavirus cell entry: from structure to neutralizing antibody__

_Centre for Infectious Diseases Research, Tsinghua University School of Life Sciences_

The recently reported Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory illness in humans with a high case fatality rate. The envelope spike glycoprotein on the surface of MERS-CoV is responsible for host cell attachment, receptor binding, and for mediating host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection. We revealed the structural basis for the binding of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein with human receptor DPP4. We also reported two potent human monoclonal antibodies (MERS-4 and MERS-27) that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein. These two antibodies were potent and synergistic in inhibiting the cell infection of pseudotyped virions. By determining the complex structures of MERS-CoV RBD with MERS-4 and MERS-27, respectively, we revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying their high neutralization activities and synergistic effects.

**Xinquan Wang** is a structural biologist. He received his bachelor degree from Fudan University at Shanghai, China in 1997 and subsequently his PhD in molecular biophysics from the Institute of Biophysics, CAS at Beijing, China in 2000. After a postdoc training in Professor Chris Garcia’s laboratory at Stanford University from 2003-2008, he came back to the School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University as a tenure track associate professor and was promoted to a tenured professor in 2013. The Wang lab’s main research interests are in cell-surface receptor recognition and activation. Recently they have been studying virus-receptor interactions involved in the cell entry of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and in the neutralization by potent monoclonal antibodies.
