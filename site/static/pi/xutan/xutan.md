####Research Interests:

We are interested in developing high throughput methods for antiviral drug discovery targeting influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, dengue virus and HIV. A multitude of technologies including bioinformatics, live cell imaging, biochemistry and structural biology are used to study the mechanisms of actions of novel antiviral small molecules. We are also interested in developing novel RNA based therapeutics for viral and other diseases. We study the mechanism of human antiviral innate immunity using functional genomics and mass spectrometry to help achieve a systems understanding of virus-host interactions. In addition, we study disease-causing mechanism and drug discovery related to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and protein degradation. We always welcome highly motivated students to join us to work in the exciting area of translational medicine.

####Selected Achievements
•	Developed a novel drug screening method to efficiently discovery synergistic drug combinations and discovered a number of drug combinations targeting HIV (Nature Biotechnology 2012)
•	Applied a high throughput method to systematically screen for antiviral RNAi sequences targeting HIV, influenza virus and hepatitis C virus (PNAS 2012)
•	Uncovered the structural mechanism of the receptors to the plant hormones auxin and jasmonate and identified inositol polyphosphates as the cofactors of the two receptors, established a novel model of hormone action (Nature 2007, Nature 2010)
