###Research interest


The Javid laboratory has two principal interests: regulation of gene translation, and study of the pathophysiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  -- still the world’s and China’s most important single pathogen.  In particular we focus on:

    1) the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis

    2) the regulation of translational fidelity in mycobacteria, humans, and model organisms such as Drosophila

    3) understanding what constitutes protective immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis

    4) developing novel therapeutics through a rational mechanistic approach that will speed up treatment of tuberculosis
